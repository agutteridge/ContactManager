Hi there,

This is my submission for Assignment 2 of the Programming in Java module.

There is a main method in ContactManagerImpl, but it does not do anything as no methods have been called.

A demo can be seen by running TestingContactManagerImpl with the appropriate JUnit .jar files.

An additional folder 'Interface test' was made to experiment with the implementations of the Meeting interfaces, and was included to demonstrate my thought process when designing the program structure.

Thank you!
Alice
